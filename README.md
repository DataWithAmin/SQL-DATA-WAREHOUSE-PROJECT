# SQL-DATA-WAREHOUSE-PROJECT

Welcome to my SQL Data Warehouse Project repository! 🚀
This project was developed as part of my SQL learning journey to demonstrate the end-to-end process of building a modern data warehouse and performing data analysis using SQL,
It highlights my understanding of data engineering, ETL pipelines, and data modeling — all essential skills in modern analytics and business intelligence.


🏗️ Data Architecture :
This project follows the Medallion Architecture framework with three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

1- Bronze Layer – Stores raw data exactly as received from the source systems (CSV files).
2- Silver Layer – Cleanses, standardizes, and integrates the data for consistency.
3- Gold Layer – Contains business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analysis.

📖 Project Overview :
This project covers the full data pipeline — from ingestion to insights:

Data Architecture – Designing and implementing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.
ETL Pipelines – Extracting, transforming, and loading data into a SQL Server database.
Data Modeling – Building fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting – Writing SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

🎯 This project showcases my growing skills in:

* SQL Development
* Data Warehousing
* Data Engineering
* ETL Pipeline Development
* Data Modeling
* Business Intelligence & Analytics

🛠️ Tools & Technologies :

*Datasets: Raw CSV files used for data ingestion.
*SQL Server Express: Database engine for hosting the data warehouse.
*SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Tool for developing and testing SQL queries.
*DrawIO: Used to design architecture, data models, and ETL flow diagrams.
*GitHub: For version control and portfolio presentation.
*Notion: For project documentation and task organization.

🚀 Project Requirements
1. Data Engineering – Building the Data Warehouse :

Objective: Develop a modern data warehouse that consolidates sales data from multiple sources to support analytical reporting and business decision-making.

Specifications:
Data Sources: Two CSV-based systems (ERP and CRM).
Data Quality: Clean and standardize data before loading.
Integration: Combine sources into one unified analytical model.
Modeling: Design a star schema with fact and dimension tables.
Documentation: Clearly describe the data model and ETL process.


2. Data Analysis – Business Intelligence & Reporting

Objective:
Generate insightful SQL-based reports to answer key business questions such as:
How do customer behaviors vary across time or region?
Which products are performing best?
What are the overall sales trends?
The final outputs include analytical SQL queries and reports that summarize these findings.
